It's part of the *"Breaking Bad"* franchise and functions as a spin-off of Gilligan's earlier series, "Breaking Bad" (2008--2013). Primarily serving as a prequel, "Better Call Saul" is set before and during the events of "Breaking Bad," with certain scenes extending into the post-"Breaking Bad" timeline.

## Plot

The series begins with **Jimmy McGill**, played by *Bob Odenkirk*, working as a struggling lawyer trying to establish his legal career. Jimmy is a good-hearted but morally flexible attorney who often finds himself on the wrong side of the law while trying to make ends meet.

As the series progresses, Jimmy's personal and professional life becomes increasingly complex. He grapples with ethical dilemmas and faces challenges both in and out of the courtroom. Throughout the show, we witness Jimmy's transformation into **Saul Goodman**, the flamboyant and unscrupulous lawyer known for his colorful personality and questionable legal tactics.

## Broadcast

<u>Better Call Saul</u> premiered on the cable network AMC, attracting 4.4 million viewers aged 18--49 and 4 million viewers aged 25--54, with an overall viewership of 6.9 million. This marked the highest-rated scripted series premiere in basic cable history at the time, though it was later surpassed by another AMC show, *Fear the Walking Dead*.

In December 2013, <u>Netflix</u> announced that the entire first season would be available for streaming in the U.S. after the first-season finale aired, with episodes released shortly after in Latin America and Europe. However, the first season didn't arrive on Netflix in the U.S. until February 1, 2016. Internationally, episodes from the second season were available for streaming the day after their U.S. airing.

Netflix was the exclusive video-on-demand provider for the series, available worldwide except in Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, Better Call Saul premiered on Stan on February 9, 2015, becoming the flagship program. In New Zealand, it was exclusive to Lightbox until 2020 when both services merged into Neon.

In the UK and Ireland, Netflix acquired the series in December 2013, premiering the first episode on February 9, 2015, followed by weekly releases. In Ireland, it also aired on TV network TG4 starting October 18, 2022. In India, episodes were broadcast on Colors Infinity within 24 hours of the U.S. airing.

During the final season in 2022, episodes were available for streaming on AMC+'s streaming service the same day they premiered on AMC. The season premiere led to the highest number of new subscriber sign-ups for AMC+, with a significant increase in episodic viewership on the platform by the mid-season finale. The series finale caused an app outage due to high demand, with first-day viewing numbers on AMC+ four times higher than the season premiere, making it the biggest acquisition driver in the history of the streaming service according to AMC.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

season <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, "6A", "6B")
average_views <- c(3.21, 2.16, 1.64, 1.49, 1.37, 1.27, 1.27) 

data2 <- data.frame(Season = season, Average_Views = average_views)

ggplot(data2, aes(x = Season, y = Average_Views, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(color = "red") +

```
### Observed changes
```{r}
data2 <- data.frame(Season = season, Average_Views = average_views)
drop1 <- -((data2$Average_Views[data2$Season == 2]/data2$Average_Views[data2$Season == 1])-1)*100
drop1_adj <- paste(round(drop1, 2), "%")

drop2 <- -((data2$Average_Views[data2$Season == 3]/data2$Average_Views[data2$Season == 2])-1)*100
drop2_adj <- paste(round(drop2, 2), "%")

last_season <- tail(data2$Average_Views, 2)
last_adj <- mean(last_season)
```
According to the graph, the average viewership had declined with each season. The most dramatic drop in average views occured between seasons 1 and 2, where the figure decreased by `r drop1_adj`. Similarly, the views fell by `r drop2_adj` between seasons 2 and 3. After season 3, the number of average views plunged at a relatively constatnt rate. By the end of the show (last two seasons), the figure for average views remained at the same level (`r last_adj` million).
